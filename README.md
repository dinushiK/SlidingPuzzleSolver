# SlidingPuzzleSolver
Algorithm to solve Sliding Puzzles!

## Overview
SlidingPuzzleSolver is a Java-based application designed to find the shortest path in a sliding puzzle game using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. Given a start and finish point, the program navigates through a map, avoiding obstacles, to determine the optimal route.

## Features
- Implements BFS for shortest path finding.
- Handles arbitrary map sizes and obstacle placements.
- Outputs the sequence of moves from start to finish.
- Simple and efficient algorithmic design.
